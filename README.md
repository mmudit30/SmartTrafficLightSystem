# SmartTrafficLightSystem

This project was made as a demo to visualize the idea of smart traffic light system.

The idea is to change the timing of traffic lights' color according to the Traffic by sensing it through sensors.  

This project uses Arduino Uno and IR Sensor as main components for a demo purpose.
